Abstract
----------

The look-ahead estimator is used to compute densities associated with
Markov processes via simulation.  We study a framework that extends the
look-ahead estimator to a broader range of applications.  We provide a
general asymptotic theory for the estimator, where both :math:`L_1` consistency
and :math:`L_2` asymptotic normality are established.  The :math:`L_2` asymptotic
normality implies :math:`\sqrt{n}` convergence rates for :math:`L_2` deviation.


Code
